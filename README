This should become a repository of most of the PHP library for PostgreSQL.

== Data Types ==
There are some restrictions as php datatypes are more flexible the the
PostgreSQL datatypes. Here are the matching postgres datatypes which will be
used:

* Numeric
bigint ... Integer type, 8 byte
float  ... Variable-precision, 15 decimal digits

* Text
text   ... Some text, unlimited length

* Arrays
text[]   ... Arrays of texts
bigint[] ... Array of integers
float[]  ... Array of numbers
hstore   ... Associative array, keys and values are texts with a max. of 65535
             bytes 

== Notes ==
You have to create the language plpgsql as most of the functions are using this language:
psql -d DB -c 'create language plpgsql'

The hstore module has to be loaded before loading the library. Use this on a
current Ubuntu (10.10 Maverick Meerkat) installation:
psql -d DB -f /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/hstore.sql
